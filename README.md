# Task Manager App (Node.js + Express)

## Overview
This is a simple Task Manager web application built with Node.js and Express. The app allows users to add, view, and manage tasks. However, please note that the app is still in development, and certain features like authorization and authentication have not been implemented yet. Additionally, at this stage, any task added by one user can be seen by anyone who clicks the link to access the app.

## Deployment
The Task Manager app has been deployed and is accessible online. You can check it out [here](https://your-task-manager-app.com).

## Disclaimer
This app is still in development, and the security features are not yet implemented, do not use it for any sensitive or critical tasks at this stage.


## Prerequisites
Before running the Task Manager app on your local machine, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- npm (Node Package Manager, typically installed along with Node.js)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To start the Task Manager app, run the following command:
```
npm start
```

This will launch the app on the default port (usually 3000). Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Functionality
- View all tasks: Users can view all the tasks currently in the system.
- Add a new task: Users can add new tasks to the system.

## Roadmap
As mentioned earlier, the app is still in development, and certain critical features are yet to be implemented. Here's a rough roadmap of the upcoming features:

1. **Authorization and Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization to secure access to the app's functionality. This will ensure that only authenticated users can add, view, and manage their own tasks.

2. **Private Tasks:** Modify the app to ensure that tasks added by a user are only visible to that user and not accessible by others.

3. **User Profile:** Introduce user profiles to enable users to manage their tasks and account settings.

4. **Task Management:** Enhance the task management functionality with features like sorting tasks.

5. **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance the app's user interface and experience to make it more intuitive and visually appealing.
